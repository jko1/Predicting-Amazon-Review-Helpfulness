# Predicting-Amazon-Review-Helpfulness

A large number of Amazon product reviews have little to no user feedback, thus making it difﬁcult for listings to emphasize helpful opinions while relegating less insightful comments. Hence, we present a deep learning solution for classifying the best and worst product reviews. Our model leverages a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture and is the ﬁrst to go beyond traditional text classiﬁcation methods in this problem space.
